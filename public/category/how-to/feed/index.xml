<p>And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.</p>

<blockquote class="pullquote align-left"><p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul</p></blockquote>
<p>On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word &#8220;and&#8221; and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.</p>
<p>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again.</p>

<h3>What to do in Uluwatu Bali</h3>

<p>A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table &#8211; Samsa was a travelling salesman &#8211; and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p>
<p>Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. &#8220;How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense&#8221;, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn&#8217;t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.</p>
<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. &#8220;What&#8217;s happened to me? &#8221; he thought. It wasn&#8217;t a dream.</p>
<p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table &#8211; Samsa was a travelling salesman &#8211; and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.</p>
